<h2>Project Summary</h2>

<h3>UX</h3>
My UX process is to make looking after your eyes easy. My project is aimed at users who want information on common eye conditions, advice on picking the right frames, and finding an opticians nearby. 

<h2>User Stories</h2>
<h3>Site Users</h3>
As a glasses wearer, I want to get information on conditions, frames and find nearby opticians, so that I can look after the health of my eyes. 

<h3>Site Owners</h3>
As the site owner, I wanted to achieve a singular place glasses or potential glasses wearers will come for all their optical information.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>

<h2>Testing</h2>
During the initial stages of the project I used Chrome developer tools for testing my site. Using the device toolbar to continually check that my structure and content worked on the mobile and desktop screen as intended. I frequently tested the different classes and rules that were applying to different elements to bug test on things that weren't behaving as they should, but also to test out possible solutions before moving those solutions into my code.

I have tested the site in a range of browsers Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Microsoft edge and Internet explorer.

I ran the HTML and the CSS through W3C Validation services to ensure that the code that i have written does not have any syntax errors.
